This is the experiment branch

Modifying the Navier-Stokes equations for text analysis is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of both fluid dynamics and natural language processing. The Navier-Stokes equations describe how the velocity field of a fluid evolves over time and are given by:

The intersection of fluid dynamics and text analysis presents a fascinating fusion of physics and linguistics, one that may seem unconventional at first glance. Fluid dynamics, a branch of physics with a focus on how fluids behave and interact with various forces, is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations, which are central to the field, provide a mathematical model for the motion of fluid substances.

In the realm of text analysis, we deal with the flow of languageâ€”its rhythm, its ebb and flow of sentiments, and the propagation of ideas. By drawing parallels between the physical properties of fluids and the abstract properties of text, we embark on a novel approach to understanding linguistic patterns. The velocity field in fluid dynamics, represented by ($\vec{u}$), can be thought of as the rate at which certain sentiments or themes move through a body of text. Time ($t$) remains a constant in both domains, marking the progression of narrative or discourse.

Density ($\rho$) in text could be analogous to the concentration of specific linguistic features or sentiments, while pressure ($p$) might represent the intensity or strength of the language used. Viscosity ($\nu$), a measure of a fluid's resistance to deformation, could be likened to the complexity or readability of a text. Lastly, external forces ($\vec{g}$) in fluid dynamics could correspond to external influences on text, such as cultural or contextual factors.

By adapting the Navier-Stokes equations to the analysis of text, we propose a method to quantify and model the dynamics of language much like we would a physical fluid system. This innovative approach holds the potential to unravel the complexities of communication and offer a more granular understanding of how ideas and emotions flow within and between texts.

$$
\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla) \vec{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \vec{u} + \vec{g}
$$

Here, ($\vec{u}$) is the velocity, ($t$) is time, ($\rho$) is density, ($p$) is pressure, ($\nu$) is viscosity, and ($\vec{g}$) is an external force.

### Conceptual Mapping

1. **Velocity ($\vec{u}$)**: This could represent the "speed" at which a sentiment is propagating through the text. For example, a rapid shift from positive to negative sentiment could be considered a high "velocity."
2. **Time ($t$)**: This remains as the position of a sentence or word in the text, serving as a temporal marker.
3. **Density ($\rho$)**: This could represent the "density" of specific sentiments in a given section of text. A paragraph filled with positive words would have a high "density" of positive sentiment.
4. **Pressure ($p$)**: This could be analogous to the intensity of a sentiment. Stronger words ("love," "hate") exert more "pressure" than weaker ones ("like," "dislike").
5. **Viscosity ($\nu$)**: This could represent the resistance to the flow of sentiment, perhaps due to the complexity or ambiguity of the text.
6. **External Force ($\vec{g}$)**: This could be external factors like cultural context or the influence of preceding text segments.

## Interpretation of the values on the x-axis for each of the metrics

To precisely interpret the values on the x-axis for each of the metrics calculated by your code, consider the following:

1. **Sentiment Density (`rho_sent`)**:

   - **X-axis Values**: Represents the sum of the absolute values of sentiment scores.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - A higher value on the x-axis indicates a review with more intense sentiment expressions, whether positive or negative.
     - A lower value suggests milder sentiment expressions.
     - A value close to zero implies a neutral or very balanced sentiment in the review.
2. **Sentiment Pressure (`p_sent`)**:

   - **X-axis Values**: Represents the sentiment score of sentences that contain specific keywords.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Positive values indicate the presence of keywords that contribute to a positive sentiment in the sentence.
     - Negative values suggest the presence of keywords that contribute to a negative sentiment.
     - A value of zero indicates either the absence of keywords or a neutral sentiment in the sentence.
3. **Sentiment Viscosity (`nu_sent`)**:

   - **X-axis Values**: Represents the standard deviation of sentiment scores within a review.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Higher values indicate a review with a wide range of sentiment scores, suggesting complex or nuanced sentiment expressions.
     - Lower values suggest more uniform sentiment expressions within the review.
4. **External Contextual Force (`g_context`)**:

   - **X-axis Values**: Represents a predefined value based on the overall tone of the text.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - A value of +1 indicates an overall positive tone in the text.
     - A value of -1 indicates an overall negative tone.
     - A value of 0 indicates a neutral or mixed overall tone.

In summary, the x-axis values for each metric provide insights into different aspects of sentiment in text. Higher or lower values on the x-axis reflect the intensity, specificity, variability, and contextual influences of sentiments within the text. These values help in understanding the dynamic nature of sentiment flow, akin to studying various properties of a fluid in motion.

### Modified Equation

A modified Navier-Stokes equation for sentiment flow ($\vec{s}$) could look something like:

$$
\frac{\partial \vec{s}}{\partial t} + (\vec{s} \cdot \nabla) \vec{s} = -\frac{1}{\rho_{\text{sent}}} \nabla p_{\text{sent}} + \nu_{\text{sent}} \nabla^2 \vec{s} + \vec{g}_{\text{context}}
$$

Here, $\rho_{\text{sent}}$, $p_{\text{sent}}$, and $\nu_{\text{sent}}$ are the density, pressure, and viscosity of sentiment, respectively, and $\vec{g}_{\text{context}}$ is the external contextual force.

### Computational Implementation

1. **Discretization**: The text would be discretized into segments (e.g., sentences or paragraphs), and the sentiment in each would be quantified to serve as initial conditions.
2. **Numerical Methods**: Techniques like finite difference or finite element methods could be used to solve the modified equation computically.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: These would need to be set based on the text. For example, the sentiment at the beginning and end of the text could serve as boundary conditions.

By adapting the Navier-Stokes equations in this way, you could create a computational model to simulate how sentiment flows through a text, allowing for more nuanced analyses that take into account both the internal dynamics of the text and external influences.

### Conceptual Mapping

1. **Linguistic Elements as Particles**: In fluid dynamics, particles of fluid flow in a particular direction under certain conditions. Similarly, words or phrases in a text could be considered as particles flowing in the narrative.
2. **Text as a Fluid Medium**: Just as fluids have properties like viscosity and density, a text has properties such as complexity, tone, and style that could affect the "flow" of its linguistic elements.
3. **Forces and Fields**: In fluid dynamics, external forces like gravity or electromagnetic fields can affect fluid flow. In text, external influences could be the cultural, social, or psychological factors that shape language use.

### Mathematical Modeling

1. **Navier-Stokes Equations**: These fundamental equations in fluid dynamics could be adapted to model how linguistic elements move and interact within the "fluid" of the text.
2. **Turbulence and Chaos**: These complex fluid behaviors could be analogous to the unpredictability and complexity found in natural language.
3. **Streamlines and Pathlines**: These could represent the flow of narrative or argument in a text, showing how individual linguistic elements move and change.

### Computational Techniques

1. **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**: This could be adapted into a Computational Text Dynamics model to simulate the flow of linguistic elements in a text.
2. **Finite Element Analysis**: This could be used to break down a text into smaller "elements" for individual analysis, similar to how it's used in fluid dynamics to study complex geometries.

### Applications

1. **Sentiment Flow**: Analyze how sentiments and emotions "flow" through a text

, affecting reader perception.

2. **Narrative Structure**: Use fluid dynamics to model how a narrative moves and changes, identifying "eddies" of tension or "streams" of thematic elements.
3. **Language Evolution**: Study how languages change over time, using fluid dynamics to model the "flow" of linguistic elements between different languages or dialects.
4. **Information Diffusion**: Model how information "flows" through a network of texts, such as academic citations or social media posts.

By integrating the mathematical rigor of fluid dynamics with the qualitative nuances of text analysis, one could develop a powerful new toolset for understanding language in a dynamic, interactive way.

### Why?

Calculating sentiment flow can be useful for several reasons, even if the text has already been tagged with sentiments. Here are some reasons:

1. **Temporal Dynamics**: Sentiment flow allows you to analyze how sentiments change over time. If you have a series of temporal texts (such as tweets during an event), sentiment flow can show how the overall sentiment evolves.
2. **Relationships and Interactions**: If you are analyzing conversations or discussion threads, sentiment flow can help you understand how sentiments interact and influence each other. For example, you may find that negative comments tend to generate negative responses, creating a ripple effect.
3. **Event Impact**: Sentiment flow can be used to assess the impact of specific events on public sentiment. This can be especially useful in studies involving public reaction to news or announcements.
4. **Prediction**: Analyzing sentiment flow can help predict future trends or audience reactions. This can be useful in fields such as marketing, reputation management, or politics.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Sentiment flow can be used to compare how different groups react to the same stimulus or event, potentially revealing cultural, demographic or other differences.
6. **Interventions and Changes**: If you are part of an organization that seeks to improve public perception, sentiment flow can help you measure the effectiveness of your strategies over time and make adjustments based on the data.

In summary, even if sentiments have already been labeled, sentiment flow provides an additional dimension of analysis beyond simple labeling, offering a more dynamic and interactive view of sentiments within a dataset.
